The East London Garden Society was formed in 2011 to promote urban gardening and to put views forward to protect the environment in which we all live. The website contains a variety of useful information, including campaigns under way at this point in time plus a host of other useful data about plants and local gardens/parks. I designed the website in 2011 for the ELGS and manage it.
