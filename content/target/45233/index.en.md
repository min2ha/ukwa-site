It’s hard not to get the impression that many politicians and officials believe that the public’s choice in the June 23rd referendum to vote for Brexit was as a result of stupidity and therefore can be ignored — even though the only purpose of the referendum was to allow the public to decide whether or not the UK should remain in or leave the European Union.
