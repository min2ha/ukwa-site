# Amington War Memorial

The focus for the project is a World War 1 War Memorial in Amington Cemetery, the Memorial was erected in 1917 for the fallen of the local area, the reasons for this are currently unknown. The base of the memorial is in extremely poor condition and requires some restoration works in order to fully support and stabilise the upper part. We would also like to level the area surrounding the memorial so as it is accessible to disabled/wheelchair users and also develop a memorial garden. We would like to involve some young people to research the significance of the memorial and the family that commissioned the memorial and why. Also listing the names of the fallen who currently aren't recorded on site. We will install an information board displaying our research and the list of the fallen names together with a map of the Western Front showing where each person died. The new memorial garden around the Memorial will provide an area of reflection for visitors as well as informing them of the history of the memorial. A website will be developed and linked to the information board by a QR code and url.
