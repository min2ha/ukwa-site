# Miners' Bridge Pontrhydygroes

Plynlimon Heritage Trust built a footbridge over the River Ystwyth in Pontrhydygroes,  on a site of a former miners’ footbridge, built in the nineteenth century, when Pontrhydygroes was the centre of a thriving lead-mining industry. The old bridge is thought to have collapsed around 1920.
