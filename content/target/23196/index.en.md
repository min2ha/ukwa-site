# Evode History Project

The Evode Group of Companies began as Spic and Span Shoe Polishes Ltd of Glover Street, Stafford, which was incorporated on 3 June 1932 and partly owned by Lotus Ltd, the shoe manufacturers. The Glover Street premises was subject to flooding, and had only five staff and £30 worth of equipment when Dr Hermann Simon joined the Company as a director and chemist in 1937 from Germany, where he was a successful manufacturer of protective paints and waterproofing compounds. In the early years he made use of a gas burner and a collection of saucepans to develop his products. He was to head the Company until his death in 1978. On joining the Company he expanded the product range by adding building chemicals and, soon after his arrival, its name was changed to Spic and Span Chemical Products Ltd, which was incorporated on 19 May 1938. Later the same year the name was changed yet again to Dove Chemical Products Ltd because the Dove brand of polish was the company's most successful and well-known product. The company was incorporated on 12 October 1938.
