# National Audit Office: The Customs Declaration Service: a progress update

The UK and EU have made progress towards an agreement that will leave customs arrangements unchanged until December 2020. However, until this agreement is confirmed, the government has directed HMRC to continue planning for a ‘no deal’ scenario with the expectation that a fully scaled and operational customs system will be in place in March 2019. In response to the concerns we highlighted in July 2017, HMRC has accelerated its plans to develop the existing CHIEF system as a contingency option. This has reduced the risk that it will not be able to handle the potential increased volume of customs declarations at the end of March 2019, in the event of ‘no deal’. The contingency option is still to be fully tested, and the success of customs preparations will involve many other dependent systems and processes at the border. However, if HMRC completes this work successfully, it will be in a better position in the event that CDS is not ready or does not perform as planned.
