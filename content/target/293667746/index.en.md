# Scottish Communists

The Communist Party of Scotland (CPS; Pàrtaidh Co-Mhaoineach na h-Alba) was established in 1991 when the Communist Party of Great Britain was disbanded and re-formed as the Democratic Left think-tank. Scottish Communists disagreed with this decision and instead set up the CPS, with its headquarters in Partick, Glasgow.
