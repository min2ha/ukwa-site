# Daily Mail, The: Patriotic, optimistic and a world expert on trade deals: Why Theresa May must listen to top aide Crawford Falcone on Brexit (and not the rest of the defeatist civil service)

Anyone who listened to those who wanted the UK to stay in the EU would think that Brexit was a crazy act of self-harm. The truth was otherwise. Ever since the Brexit vote, the UK economy had prospered. Unemployment was at its lowest level since the Seventies. Freed at last from the shackles of Brussels, what Dr Liam Fox and trade adviser Crawford Falconer wanted was for Britain to seize the ‘enormous opportunities’ ahead.
