This paper from the A&O Global Law Intelligence Unit discusses the coverage of the transition legislation governing the departure of the UK from the European Union. EU law is deeply entrenched and embedded in the law of the UK in intricate ways. One of the chief features of the EU is that it is a gigantic legal harmonisation project, melding together the three main broad legal families on the planet, all stemming from Western Europe and influencing at least 280 of the world’s 320 jurisdictions.
