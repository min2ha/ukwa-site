# Joint Committee on Human Rights: Legislative Scrutiny: The EU (Withdrawal) Bill: a Right by Right Analysis

The Committee is particularly concerned with the human rights implications of excluding the Charter of Fundamental Rights from retained EU law. Since the Committee was reconstituted,it has pressed the Government for the publication of its Memorandum on the European Convention on Human Rights and sought some further clarification regarding the human rights implications of the Bill. Correspondence relating to this matter can be found on the Committee’s webpages. On 5 December 2017 the Government published its ‘Right by Right’ analysis of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. A commentary on this, which demonstrates the complexity of the post-exit human rights landscape, was produced for the Committee. The Committee thinks  this document would assist further debate on the Bill, and it is publishing it as an Appendix to this Report.
