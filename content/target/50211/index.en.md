This report examines what the Government’s pledge to deliver control over EU immigration might mean in practice. The free movement of persons is a legal construct, and its foundations are in EU law. It is set to end automatically when the UK ceases to be a member of the EU bound by EU law. If negotiations under Article 50 were to conclude without an agreement on this issue, the default outcome is that UK nationals would become third-country nationals for the purposes of EU law and the domestic immigration rules of EU member states. For its part, the UK could place EU immigrants on the same footing as non-EU immigrants. At the other end of the spectrum of possible outcomes, negotiations could lead to new, reciprocal and preferential arrangements for UK-EU migration falling short of free movement as it exists today but coming close in some or even many respects.
