# Manchester Together Archive, The

After the Manchester Arena attack in May 2017 over 10,000 objects  were left by members of the public in spontaneous memorials that sprang up in St. Ann’s Square and other sites in the city. This website provides an account of how those objects have been cared for and plans for the future to create a public-facing digital archive. The project is a collaboration between the Manchester Art Gallery, Archives+ and the University of Manchester.
