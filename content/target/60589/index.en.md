# Civitas: The Brussels Broadcasting Corporation?: How pro-Brexit views have been marginalised in the BBC’s news coverage

For at least the past two decades, opinion polls have shown a large number of voters have wanted the UK to leave the European Union. When the question was finally put in the June 2016 referendum, the electorate voted to do just that by a margin of 52 per cent to 48 per cent. Yet the clear preference of a large section of the population for withdrawal, and the reasons for so many people taking this stance, have been marginalised in the BBC’s coverage of EU issues for most of the past 20 years.
