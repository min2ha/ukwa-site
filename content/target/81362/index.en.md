# Independent: Theresa May calls on Labour MPs to put 'national interest' first and back her Brexit deal in defiance of Corbyn

Theresa May told Labour MPs they should put the “national interest” ahead of loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn when it came to a decision over whether to back her government’s Brexit plans. This came amid reports that up to 30 Brexit-backing Labour MPs might support Ms May’s deal, while Tory Eurosceptics said they had 40 ready to vote against it.
