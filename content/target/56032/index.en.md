This report looks at four elements of the EU’s data protection package: the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Police and Criminal Justice Directive (PCJ), the EU-US Privacy Shield and the EU-US Umbrella Agreement. Both the GDPR and the PCJ will enter into force in May 2018 while the UK is still a member of the EU. The EU-US Privacy Shield and EU-US Umbrella Agreement are already in force but will cease to apply to the UK post-Brexit. For third countries looking to exchange data with the EU, the GDPR and PCJ provide for two broad options. The first would be for the UK to receive an ‘adequacy decision’ from the European Commission certifying that it provides a standard of protection which is “essentially equivalent” to EU data protection standards. The second option would be for individual data controllers and processors to adopt their own safeguards offering an adequate level of protection to enable personal data to be transferred out of the EU.
