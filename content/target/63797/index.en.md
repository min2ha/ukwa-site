# House of Commons Library: Brexit: Devolution and legislative consent

Legislative consent is a fundamental part of the territorial constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom. The self-denying ordinance of the UK Parliament that it will normally only legislate with regard to devolved matters with the consent of the devolved legislature is a non-legal constitutional constraint. It helps to protect and preserve autonomous spheres of constitutional authority with regard to devolved legislatures and their related institutions. The withdrawal of the UK from the European Union poses significant challenges to the existing devolution settlements in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Several key pieces of legislation, deemed necessary by the UK Government to deliver its policy of withdrawing the UK from the EU, have significant implications for the powers of the devolved legislatures and executive bodies.
