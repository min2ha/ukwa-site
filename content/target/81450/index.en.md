# Guardian, The: Revealed: secret Brexit plans to appease DUP with transition extension

The Guardian revealed secret plans to allow an extension of the transition period in the Brexit withdrawal agreement which could result in the UK living under all EU rules well beyond the 21 months originally negotiated. The expected offer of an extension was designed to convince Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, that the “backstop” plan to avoid the creation of a hard border on the island of Ireland would never come into force.
