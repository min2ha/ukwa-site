# Pregnant Then Screwed

Pregnant Then Screwed is a project which aims to raise awareness of pregnancy discrimination in the UK. The project is a place for women to tell their stories anonymously, giving victims a voice, while demonstrating how systemic the problem really is. Despite discrimination against pregnant women being illegal, and organisations existing to assist victims, the number of women who are pushed out of their jobs due to pregnancy has doubled since 2005. Through their stories, they hope that they can prove this is happening and talk about the effect it has had on their careers, their confidence and their mental and physical health.
