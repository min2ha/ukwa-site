This project emerges from the ‘Creating Living Knowledge’ report which identified the need to actively foster collaborations between universities and Black and minority ethnic communities in Arts and Humanities research. It seeks to explore how common cause can be made between universities, communities and funding bodies who are looking to create an Arts and Humanities knowledge base that reflects the interests, histories, cultures and experiences of all diverse communities in the UK. Common Cause is part of the Connected Communities programme and is linked to the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) theme Translating Cultures. The key focus of the project is on collaborative research that is co-produced between universities and Black and minority ethnic communities in the Arts and Humanities field. ‘Co-produced’ in the context of Common Cause refers to research that is undertaken with the active participation of communities, not research that is conducted ‘on’ them. The project will work with arts and community organisations who either originate from within Black and minority ethnic communities, or who are committed to co-producing research with these communities.
