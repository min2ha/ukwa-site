# Possible Futures

Wet Picnic will work with 4 primary school groups in Eastleigh, Hampshire, on a WW1 heritage project called “Possible Futures”. We will use detailed research of stories of the people in Eastleigh at the time of WW1 and look at the impact the war had on the local community. Professional artists will facilitate street theatre workshops over a period of 11 weeks, where pupils will engage with local history and stories; imagining the possible futures of soldiers who served and died, looking at the stories of people who served and lived while also imagining their own possible futures. The students will have access to their local museum, and will take part in “Our Town in the Past,” a workshop on Eastleigh 100 years ago. The project will finish with a public showing of the information gathered where friends and family of the children are invited. Using street theatre as a tool to transpose the research into an accessible format, and by performing in the space that the pupils have been researching; the project also invites members of the public to engage with their local history.
