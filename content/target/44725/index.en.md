# Allen and Overy: Potential mechanisms for a UK exit from the European Union and what follows next

While the EU Treaties expressly anticipate “ever closer union” between Member States, they do also contemplate a Member State leaving.

This specialist paper analyses four aspects of the potential mechanisms for a UK exit from the European Union and what follows next.
