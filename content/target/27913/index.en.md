# Myatt Garden Primary School

The school maintain the belief that they must help their children to be ‘expert learners’. Every child has success within them and their aim is to provide a stimulating environment where children can achieve their own success. They need to learn how to learn. Expert learners are self-aware, have faith in their ability to learn new skills and judge how their new skills will be needed. They know that learning is for life.
