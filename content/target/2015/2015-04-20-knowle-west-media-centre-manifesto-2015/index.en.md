The Knowle West Media Centre is an arts organisation and charity based in Bristol and they’ve been supporting individuals and communities to get the most out of digital technologies and the arts since 1996. In practice, this means providing exciting and relevant ways for people to get involved in community activism, education, employment, and local decision-making.
