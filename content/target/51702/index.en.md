The Ciliopathy Alliance brings together patient support groups, researchers, doctors and allied health professionals representing patients and families living with and affected by ciliopathies - diseases caused by defects in the function or structure of cilia.

Dysfunctional cilia are known to underlie a number of often chronically disabling and sometimes life-threatening genetic conditions. They affect multiple systems, causing blindness, deafness, chronic respiratory infections, kidney disease, heart disease, infertility, obesity and diabetes.
