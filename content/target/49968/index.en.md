# St Martin in the Bullring

St Martin in the Bullring is a Christian community seeking to discover the heart of God in the heart of the city of Birmingham. We believe that the Christian faith is about exploration and life.  St Martin’s isn’t just a church in the traditional sense of that word. As well as regular prayer and worship the community tries to serve those who need help in practical and creative ways, particularly those who find themselves on the edge of life.
