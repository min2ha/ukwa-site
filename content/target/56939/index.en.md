# Daily Mail, The: A spectacular betrayal of Labour voters - but Corbyn's U-turn HAS put Mrs May on the spot 

Argues that Jeremy Corbyn’s decision to endorse continued membership of the European Single Market beyond March 2019, when Britain leaves the EU, is an act of grotesque hypocrisy. It is a betrayal of everything we know the Labour leader believes — dressed up as concern for jobs and the economy — done for calculated political gain and, ultimately, to thwart Brexit.
