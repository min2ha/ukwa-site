Whirlow Hall Farm is an Educational Trust which was set up in 1979 by Alan Aikin. Alan grew up in the inner city and was sent to a farm as an evacuee during the Second World War. He was so profoundly affected by his experience of farming and the countryside that years later he decided to set up a centre for all inner-city children to come and experience the wonders of the countryside and develop their understanding of where their food, farming and the countryside. Since that date, many thousands of children and young people have visited the Sheffield farm on a daily or residential basis.

The Trust is a unique environmental and educational charity, providing an outstanding learning experience to over 10,000 children and young people a year, many of them from disadvantaged backgrounds and the inner city.

For many young visitors this is the first time that they will have visited a farm or the countryside. By holding a newly-hatched chick, bottle feeding a new-born lamb or simply seeing a pig with her piglets for the first time they are having an unforgettable experience.

Their educational visits and training range from nursery through to vocational and work-based learning.
