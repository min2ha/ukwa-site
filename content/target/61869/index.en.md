# House of Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee: Pre-legislative Scrutiny of the draft Animal Welare (Sentencing and Recognition of Sentience) Bill 2017

The concepts enshrined in the draft Animal Welfare (Sentencing and Recognition of Sentience) Bill are important and worthwhile. They deserve better than to be treated in a cavalier fashion yet the impression given to the Committee is one of haste. It appears that this draft Bill has been presented to the public - and Parliament - in a far from finished state. Many of the key concepts in the Bill remain undefined, so limiting the value of pre-legislative scrutiny, while the lack of a formal regulatory impact assessment is a further troubling matter. The absence of such a document further emphasises the impression that this legislation has not been properly thought through before publication.
