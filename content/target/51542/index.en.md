# British Society for Gene and Cell Therapy

Dedicating to facilitating education, communication and the sharing of expertise and knowledge.

The aim of the British Society for Gene and Cell Therapy is to accelerate scientific progress and promote ethical and efficient transfer of gene- and cell-based technologies from the laboratory into the clinic.

Gene and cell therapy is an area where co-operation between ALL the interested parties - general public, patients, scientists, government and the media - is vital for the optimal development of these technologies and treatments, and BSGCT is working towards becoming this pro-active interface.
