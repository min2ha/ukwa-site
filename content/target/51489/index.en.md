# Gild [sic] of Freemen of the City of York

Even before the Norman Conquest and as crafts and trade developed, the concept of freemen was developing. Men ceased to be villeins. William the Conqueror who had for so long fought wars in developing and defending Normandy developed the same techniques in England. He built castles in the towns, two being in York. The Citizens were free to trade and exercise their crafts; they paid a collective tax, repaired and manned the walls, and provided troops. They were the Kings men.
