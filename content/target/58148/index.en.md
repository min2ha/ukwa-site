# Distinctly Black Country: a network for understanding yesterday's landscape today

This network aims to link people who are interested in the way the past has made the modern Black Country (a large urban area in the English West Midlands about 200 kilometres North West of London)  landscape. We also want to describe its characteristic features, and to get people out exploring the things that make it special and different.
