The National Institute of Economic and Social Research is Britain's longest established independent research institute, founded in 1938. The vision of its founders was to carry out research to improve understanding of the economic and social forces that affect people’s lives, and the ways in which policy can bring about change. Over seventy-five years later, this remains central to NIESR’s ethos. It continues to apply its expertise in both quantitative and qualitative methods and its understanding of economic and social issues to current debates and to influence policy.
