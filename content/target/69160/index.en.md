The Department has made a determined effort to address the significant and complex challenge of delivering the wide-ranging set of actions required of it to support the UK’s exit from the EU. In doing so, it has drawn on its cadre of pre-existing programme and project management expertise. Against a backdrop of prevailing strategic uncertainties over the form of the negotiations and associated timings, it is preparing the large volume of secondary legislation that is expected to be needed before March 2019 and has been working with its arm’s-length bodies to take forward a broad range of projects it considers essential to support exit. Its delivery of the Haulage Permits and Trailer Registration Bill to Parliament broadly to time demonstrated its ability to deliver a high priority.
