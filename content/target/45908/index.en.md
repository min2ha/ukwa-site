# EU Law Analysis: When can EU citizens be expelled from the UK after Brexit? The Human Rights Dimension

In the unlikely event that a worst case scenario occurs, this post demonstrates that even if EU law rights and obligations stemming from the European Communities Act 1972 were to be curtailed, the ECHR can still be utilised to protect individuals. It is also important to highlight that, if other EU Member States created similar provisions in retaliation to the UK, the ECHR would protect UK citizens in the EU. Another layer of protection for UK citizens living in EU Member States may stem from EU immigration law concerning non-EU citizens, meaning that the Charter of Fundamental Rights (CFR) would apply and would therefore be covered by Article 7 (respect for private and family life) and Article 19 (prevention of collective expulsion).
