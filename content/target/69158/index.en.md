The UK government is committed to an inclusive and transparent approach to trade negotiations.  This document provides a high-level overview of the departments engagement approach. It includes mechanisms for how we will engage with business, civil society and consumers, which will allow us to access the technical knowledge and advice that we need, for ongoing policy formation, particularly in the pre-negotiations phase of future free trade agreements with trading partners beyond the EU.
