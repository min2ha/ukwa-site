# Guardian: No ‘constructive ambiguity’. Labour will avoid Brexit cliff edge for UK economy

Announces a policy shift on the part of the Labour Party regarding EU withdrawal. Under a Labour government the UK would continue to abide by the EU’s free movement rules, accept the jurisdiction of the European court of justice on trade and economic issues, and pay into the EU budget for a period of years after Brexit, in the hope of lessening the shock of leaving to the UK economy. In a further move that will delight many pro-EU Labour backers, Jeremy Corbyn’s party will also leave open the option of the UK remaining a member of the customs union and single market for good, beyond the end of the transitional period.
