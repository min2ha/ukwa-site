# Food Research Collaboration

The Food Research Collaboration (FRC) is the only initiative in the UK dedicated to bringing together academics and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) working to improve the UK food system. An initiative of the Centre for Food Policy (CFP) at City, University of London, their mission is to facilitate more effective collaboration between academics and CSOs to produce, share and use the knowledge needed to improve UK food policy. Their longer term vision is of academic and CSO communities working better together to influence and improve UK food policy to build a healthier, more sustainable food system.

The FRC comprises a Secretariat (a team of three, chaired by Prof Corinna Hawkes and supported by Founder and Special Advisor Prof Tim Lang, all based at the CFP); a Steering Group (representing 6 universities and 7 NGOs); and the Membership (over 500 individuals from 123 CSOs and 97 universities working on a wide range of food issues across the UK).
