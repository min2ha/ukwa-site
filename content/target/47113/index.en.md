Objectives

"To raise awareness of the scale and effects of human trafficking into the UK and the EU; and to seek solutions to reduce supply and demand; and to improve welfare provisions for victims."

The Group aims to hold the Government to account, to ensure better training for the police, and greater awareness for those involved with border protection. It is committed, above all, to ensuring victims of trafficking are given proper help, consistent with the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings.
