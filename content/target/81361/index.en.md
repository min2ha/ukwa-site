# Guardian, The: Pro-remain Tory MPs will form group to vote down May's Brexit deal

A group of remain-backing Tory MPs were plotting to form a rival movement to Jacob Rees-Mogg’s highly effective Eurosceptics, with the aim of voting down Theresa May’s Brexit deal amid concerns that it would wreck the economy. Senior MPs behind the new group said they believed the Eurosceptics would eventually swing behind May’s final Brexit deal, but Tory whips had underestimated the strength of feeling from the other wing of the party.
