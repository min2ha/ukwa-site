This paper gives a brief overview of the issues of concern to the HE sector as a result of the decision to leave the EU and outlines parliamentary debate in this area. The higher education (HE) sector is a major UK industry – it contributes £73 billion to the UK economy, including £11 billion of export earnings. The sector benefits from EU membership in a number of ways such as through the free movement of staff and students and access to research funding - higher education institutions are concerned that they may lose these benefits post Brexit. The Government has put in place some guarantees around funding and students, but the final position of the sector will depend on the result of Brexit negotiations.
