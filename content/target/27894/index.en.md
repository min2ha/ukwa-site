# Belinda Sykes & Joglaresa

Directed by Belinda Sykes, this London-based British/Israeli/Irish/Arabic ensemble has been playing since 1992. Now well-established, their work focuses on connecting ancient and traditional musics but, rather than create a 'fusion' or a surreal mix of these styles, they aim to use their combined experiences (upbringings drenched in traditional Irish, English, Maghrebi, Balkan and Middle Eastern music) to create a homogenous sound - Joglaresa members spent years in North Africa and the Middle East absorbing the best traditional tunes, learning the local languages (Arabic and Hebrew).
