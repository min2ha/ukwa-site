# Meridian Trust

The principal activity of The Meridian Trust is the preservation and dissemination of Buddhist thought, culture and artistic heritage.

Over the last three decades, under the patronage of H.H. the Dalai Lama, we have created an archive of over 2,500 hours of footage, the largest of its kind in the world; one which focuses primarily on the endangered traditions of Tibet.
