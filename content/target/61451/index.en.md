# Briefings for Brexit

There is a prevailing media view that all sensible and informed people oppose Brexit. It has even become quite commonplace to associate support for Brexit with low levels of education and intellect, and to claim that reason and thought inevitably lead to an anti-Brexit view. This site was set up by a group of academics to provide a platform for the expression of opinion which believes that the future welfare of Britain and Europe require that the choice made in the Referendum should be fully and positively carried out.
