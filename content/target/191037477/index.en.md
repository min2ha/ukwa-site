The City Circle is an open circle for open minds where individuals are pushed to think outside the box. It provides a safe space for communities to self-critically discuss and debate issues that concern them. It is open to the public, all Muslim and non-Muslim opinions are welcome. Whatever your faith and whatever your politics, the City Circle remains a home for everyone. We are an independent and inclusive space.

The City Circle offers no doctrinal solutions but instead a space to explore new ideas and a place to ask questions:  to challenge and be challenged. That is how we believe creative, confident and dynamic communities develop.
