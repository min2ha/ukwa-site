The Snows of Yesteryear/Eira Ddoe’, which explored archival and personal evidence of resilience and vulnerability to extreme climate in Wales. This project, funded by the AHRC Landscape and Environment Programme, investigates how to 'reveal and relate past experiences, both historical and more recent, as ways of understanding and coping with phenomena that are increasingly regarded as markers of climate change. It explores the ways that extreme weather events are remembered and mythologised by the people of Wales, in order to interpret what is ultimately learned from them as both warning and opportunity'.
