# South Wales Borderers in 1914

This is the first time that a 1914 Star medal roll has been published online and put into the public domain. I am unaware of any other website which has attempted to capture the names and associated metadata of the 3,000+ men in a County regiment in 1914. This info is of interest to the amateur researcher, and has info which is of interest to postgrad historians looking to write a thesis.
