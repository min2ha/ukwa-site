# Valley Naturalist

This is a blog of Steven Williams' personal activities as a lifelong naturalist in the former South Wales coalfield valleys
of Gwent. In an area of Wales historically neglected by naturalists due to the perception of industrial dereliction this site documents the rich ecological resource that has now reclaimed this area.
