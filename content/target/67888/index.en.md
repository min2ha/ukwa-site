# House of Lords Hansard: 18th June 2018:  European Union (Withdrawal) Bill

The House of Lords folded  on all but one of their amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill that the House of Commons had rejected the previous week. So gone is the amendment to try and force the UK to stay in the Single Market, there is an end to attempts to make the Government seek membership of a customs union with the EU and Exit Day remains set in stone on the face of the Bill. But peers did insist on defying the Government in one area: passing the so-called 'meaningful vote' amendment conceived by Dominic Grieve and promoted in the Lords by Viscount Hailsham.
