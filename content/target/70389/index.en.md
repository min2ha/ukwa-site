# BBC News: No-deal Brexit: A costly prospect for many consumers and firms

The government's "no deal" papers reveal the complicated exercise of leaving the EU could carry significant costs for consumers and businesses if Britain and the EU fail to agree on a transition period and a subsequent trading agreement. Those increased costs would be very likely to have a negative impact on the economy and could mean higher prices in the shops as firms pass on the higher costs of doing business.
