# Catfish Study Group

The Catfish Association of Great Britain (CAGB) was started in 1973 with a handful of members with a shared passion for Siluriformes. The association was committed to spreading information about catfish and produced its first information book in 1975. Subsequent volumes of this publication formed one of the most comprehensive and informative collections of catfish related subject matter to the ever increasing aquarist movement of the 1970's and 80's. The group had Northern and Southern branches and by 1983 the association had over 500 members across the UK and abroad.
