# Eventbrite: Rethinking Windrush: 70 Years On

This June 22nd marks the 70th anniversary of the arrival of the HMS Empire Windrush to the Port of Tilbury.

The ship brought 492 passengers from Jamaica to the UK, many of whom were ex-servicemen who had fought for Britain in the Second World War, and all were in fact British subjects, rather than ‘migrants’, and as such came with full citizenship rights. It is often forgotten that those who lived under British colonialism only became subject to immigration controls in the UK after 1962.
