The Cardiff Waterways Map project was a year-long venture researching Cardiff’s changing waterscape – from its humble origins to industrial boom, while also thinking about the role it has today and in the future. The project involved local artwork; a website; tours of the waterways and museum visits were all part of the Heritage Lottery Fund Project. The website is available to use as a resource for those interested in Cardiff history, geography, ecology, city development and art that responds to the waterways.
