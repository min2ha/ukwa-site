Citizens UK has been promoting community organising in the United Kingdom since 1989. Citizens UK, initially known as London Citizens, has grown from a single city-based organisation to a nationwide community organising institution. Others had a less enduring run lasting roughly 3 years when COF was unable to finance them any longer. Along with its geographical expansion, Citizens UK is in the process of forming increasing numbers of professional community organisers. It has created a Master’s course in Community Organising in affiliation with Queen Mary University, establishing the profession of ‘Community Organiser’ through the Guild of Community Organisers teaching the disciplines of strategy and politics.
