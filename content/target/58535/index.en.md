Localgiving's mission is to strengthen UK communities by safeguarding the sustainability of the local voluntary sector. 

We do this by supporting local charitable organisations to diversify their income through online fundraising. We provide tools, training and advice to help local groups connect with supporters online, improve their digital skills and develop practical fundraising experience. We are also a leading advocate for the sector and work to raise awareness and support for local groups from the public, government and businesses.
