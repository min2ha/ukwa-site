# The Open Mosque

 AN INCLUSIVE MOSQUE FOR ALL SELF-DEFINING MUSLIMS – EVERYONE WELCOME
This new institute, unlike other mosques, will advance Qur’anic Islam, not fabricated non-scriptural fables and a chauvinist patriarchy that characterises ‘popular’ Islam today. It will openly champion an erudite, enlightened and egalitarian Islam in line with authentic Qur’anic precepts. In contrast with existing mosques, women will have equal presence, and also full parity in its governance. There will be no separate female entrances or women’s screens in the prayer hall. Most significantly, this new mosque will be autonomous, non-sectarian, gender-equal, inter-racial and unaffiliated to any specific school of thought (madhab), ideology or denomination. Qualified secular experts as well as religious specialists will act as Rotational Imams to ensure that the congregation benefits from deliberate cross-pollination. In this way, the Open Mosque will foster genuine theological self-empowerment for Muslims to get closer to the Creator and humanity.
