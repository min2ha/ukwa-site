Before the Company was established in 1929, the future status of air pilots and air navigators was very much in doubt. The small group of commercial pilots who formed the "Guild" were virtually responsible for ensuring that their successors enjoyed a professional status, and one of the Company's objectives has been to foster and improve that standing. From the beginning the Company was modelled on the lines of the old City Guilds and Livery Companies and its constitution and by-laws reflect that foundation, although its activities and work is very much contemporary.
